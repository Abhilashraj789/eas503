# Create a Person class with first name and last name
# Create a Student class that inherits from person name 
# and adds credit_hours and q_point
# The Person class should define __repr__ function
# The student class must define get_gpa()
# Read from data.tsv each line and create a student object and
# store it in a list 

# Use a for loop to find the student with the highest and lowest gpa 
# Use a lambda function to do the same using in and max
