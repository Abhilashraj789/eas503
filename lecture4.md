# Week 4

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - OOP is hard to learn and teach, so do not worry if you do not get it the first time. Give it some time
  - OOP is a paradigm shift in the way you think about writing your code
  - OOP can be used to define new types. You already know about types such as strings and floats. 

## What is OOP?
  - OOP allows you to represent or model things in the real world
    - e.g., a student or a car 
  - Class -- a blueprint for objects
    - classes can contain functions (methods) and variables/data 
      - in OOP functions are called methods
      - in OOP variables/data are called attributes
    - Example -- Student -- every student has a name, email, list of grades
  - Object -- a specific instance of the class; 
  - Definitions:
    - Object is an active data type that knows stuff and can do stuff:
      - a collection of related information
      - a set of operations to manipulate that information 
    - Instance Variable: the information stored inside the object 
    - Methods: operation functions that "live" inside the object 
    - In Python, Instance variables and methods together are called attributes. 

## Why OOP?
  - It helps you organize your code into logical, hierarchical groupings using classes.
